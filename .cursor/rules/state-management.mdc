# State Management Standards

## Zustand Store

- Use Zustand for global state management
- Keep stores focused and single-responsibility
- Implement proper TypeScript types for store state
- Use immer for immutable updates when needed
- Implement proper persistence when required

## Local State

- Use React hooks for component-local state
- Prefer `useState` for simple state
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect

## Custom Hooks

- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Keep hooks focused and single-responsibility
- Use proper TypeScript types for hook parameters and return values
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
