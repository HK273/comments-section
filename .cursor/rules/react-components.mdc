- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

## Component Guidelines

- Place components in appropriate directories based on scope
- Use index.ts files for clean exports
- Keep components under 200 lines when possible
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Use proper prop drilling or context for state management

## Component Styling

- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use consistent spacing and color tokens
- Avoid custom CSS when possible
- Use Tailwind's design system tokens
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes
- Implement dark mode support with next-themes
- Use CSS variables for theme customization
- Follow consistent spacing and typography scales

## Performance Optimization

- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Implement proper code splitting
- Use useMemo or useCallback for expensive components
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
